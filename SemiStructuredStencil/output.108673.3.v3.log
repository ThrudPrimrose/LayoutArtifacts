torch.OutOfMemoryError: HIP out of memory. Tried to allocate 15.70 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 94.07 GiB of which 15.36 GiB is free. Of the allocated memory 62.89 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 15.60 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_HIP_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
