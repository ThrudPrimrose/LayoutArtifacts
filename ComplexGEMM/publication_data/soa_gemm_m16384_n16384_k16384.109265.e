/capstor/scratch/cscs/ybudanaz/beverindace/dace/transformation/passes/simplify.py:117: UserWarning: LiftStructViews is not being applied due to incompatibility with experimental control flow blocks. If the SDFG does not contain experimental blocks, ensure the top level SDFG does not have `SDFG.using_explicit_control_flow` set to True. If LiftStructViews is compatible with experimental blocks, please annotate it with the class decorator `@dace.transformation.explicit_cf_compatible`. see `https://github.com/spcl/dace/wiki/Experimental-Control-Flow-Blocks` for more information.

/capstor/scratch/cscs/ybudanaz/beverindace/dace/codegen/targets/cuda.py:1963: UserWarning: No `gpu_block_size` property specified on map "complex_gemm_soa_merged_111". Falling back to the configuration entry `compiler.cuda.default_block_size`: 32,1,1. You can either specify the block size to use with the gpu_block_size property, or by adding nested `GPU_ThreadBlock` maps, which map work to individual threads.
